#	Functionrc is an rc file used for housing all shell functions, used in conjunction with aliasrc file, and
#	sourced within zshrc file.

# Function to mkdir $1 and cd into it.

# pygmentized cat standard output in the terminal).

# Function to make `sudoedit` and `sudo -e` have propper syntaxing with filetype autodetect working.
#	function sudoedit {
#		SUDO_COMMAND="sudoedit $@" command sudoedit "$@"
#	}
# Function for using `sudo -e` just linking to sudoedit

# Function to git clone a directory, then cd into it.

# history file so it can function independently of the shell limitations/syntaxing).

# Function to chmod the file previously edited to have executable permissions.
#	( Might have to change to 770 if write permissions are denied).
